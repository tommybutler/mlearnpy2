MXNet Python Package
====================

`MXNet <http://mxnet.io>`__ is a deep learning framework designed for
both *efficiency* and *flexibility*. It allows you to mix the flavours
of deep learning programs together to maximize the efficiency and your
productivity.

Prerequisites
-------------

This package supports Linux, Mac OSX and Windows platforms. If you have
GPU, you may want to check:
`mxnet-cu90 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu90/>`__,
`mxnet-cu90mkl <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu90mkl/>`__,
`mxnet-cu80 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu80/>`__ and
`mxnet-cu80mkl <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu80mkl/>`__ with
CUDA-8.0 support, or
`mxnet-cu75 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu75/>`__ and
`mxnet-cu75mkl <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu75mkl/>`__ with
CUDA-7.5 support. If you are using Linux without GPU, you may want to
check `mxnet-mkl <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-mkl/>`__ with MKL
support.

To install for other platforms (e.g. Windows, Raspberry Pi/ARM) or other
versions, check `Installing
MXNet <https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/versions/master/install/index.html>`__
for instructions on building from source.

Installation
------------

To install, use:

.. code:: bash
